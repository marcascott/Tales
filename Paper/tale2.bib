@article{Quick21,
   abstract = {Modeling infectious disease dynamics has been critical throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Of particular interest are the incidence, prevalence, and effective reproductive number (R t). Estimating these quantities is challenging due to under-ascertainment, unreliable reporting, and time lags between infection, onset, and testing. We propose a Multilevel Epidemic Regression Model to Account for Incomplete Data (MERMAID) to jointly estimate R t , ascertainment rates, incidence, and prevalence over time in one or multiple regions. Specifically, MERMAID allows for a flexible regression model of R t that can incorporate geographic and time-varying covariates. To account for under-ascertainment, we (a) model the ascertainment probability over time as a function of testing metrics and (b) jointly model data on confirmed infections and population-based serological surveys. To account for delays between infection, onset, and reporting, we model stochas-tic lag times as missing data, and develop an EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters. We evaluate the performance of MERMAID in simulation studies, and assess its robustness by conducting sensitivity analyses in a range of scenarios of model misspecifications. We apply the proposed method to analyze},
