Any "common" or joint datasets go here
Ok, i added the file LaDayW7to50.dta, which has now the cumulative cases added to the Cases. The cumulative cases are provided together 
with the cumulative cases rates, the two vars are "CumCases" "CumCasesRate". I think that's what you need. ONS do not provide the cases rates (at least, i couldn't find them)
but the cumulatives cases are simply the cases added over time, so i think retrieving the cases rates could be computed from them.
They have re-organised the sites, making it more difficult to get what we want now!
